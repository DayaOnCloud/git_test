# git add "file name (index.html)"
    - adds the new/modified file to the Staging Area. The staging area is part of the two-step process for making a commit in Git. Think of the staging area as a “waiting room” for your changes until you commit them.
# git commit -m "Add a comment here to describe what you've changed/added"
    - This command is used to record changes in the repository
# git push / git push origin main
    - pushes/uploads your work/changes to the GitHub repository
